# Drone-control-simulation-by-hand-movement
Simulation is done in V-rep(coppelasim) software with help of Matlab sofware for image processing

Note- 1.Before starting anything remApi.m ,remoteApiProto.m ,the appropriate remote API library: "remoteApi.dll" (Windows) are on same folder where matlab code is placed
      2.Check connection of V-rep with matlab by opening any of the scene, stating simulation and running simpleTest.m in matlab to check matlab-vrep are connected or not.
      3.Bring a object similar in colour shown in image to control drone or you can use a video provided
